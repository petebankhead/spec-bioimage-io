# Weight formats in model spec 0.3
## Common \[optional\] key word arguments for all weight formats

- `source` Link to the source file. Preferably a url.
- `[attachments]` Dictionary of text keys and list values (that may contain any valid yaml) to additional, relevant files that are specific to the current weight format. A list of URIs can be listed under the `files` key to included additional files for generating the model package.
- `[authors]` A list of authors. If this is the root weight (it does not have a `parent` field): the person(s) that have trained this model. If this is a child weight (it has a `parent` field): the person(s) who have converted the weights to this format.
- `[parent]` The source weights used as input for converting the weights to this format. For example, if the weights were converted from the format `pytorch_state_dict` to `pytorch_script`, the parent is `pytorch_state_dict`. All weight entries except one (the initial set of weights resulting from training the model), need to have this field.
- `[sha256]` SHA256 checksum of the source file specified. You can drag and drop your file to this [online tool](http://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256_checksum.html) to generate it in your browser. Or you can generate the SHA256 code for your model and weights by using for example, `hashlib` in Python. 
Code snippet to compute SHA256 checksum

```python
import hashlib

filename = "your filename here"
with open(filename, "rb") as f:
  bytes = f.read() # read entire file as bytes
  readable_hash = hashlib.sha256(bytes).hexdigest()
  print(readable_hash)
  ```
